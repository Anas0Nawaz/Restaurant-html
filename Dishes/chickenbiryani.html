    <p>Chicken biryani is a flavorful and aromatic dish originating from South Asia, particularly popular in India and Pakistan. It combines tender chicken pieces marinated in spices with fragrant basmati rice, infused with saffron and a blend of spices such as cumin, cardamom, and cloves. This dish often includes caramelized onions, yogurt, and sometimes potatoes, all layered together to create a rich and complex flavor profile. Garnished with fresh cilantro, mint, and fried onions, chicken biryani is enjoyed with accompaniments like raita (yogurt sauce) or salad, offering a satisfying and memorable dining experience.</p>
