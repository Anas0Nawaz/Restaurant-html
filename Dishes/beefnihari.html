    <h1>Beef Nihari <img src="../Images/beefnihari.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="90"></h1>
    <p>Beef Nihari is a flavorful and hearty stew originating from the Indian subcontinent, particularly popular in Pakistan and Northern India. It is made with tender pieces of beef simmered slowly in a rich and aromatic gravy infused with spices like ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The dish is cooked until the beef is incredibly tender and the gravy thickens to a velvety consistency. Nihari is typically served with naan bread or steamed rice and is garnished with fresh ginger, chopped cilantro, and slices of lemon. It is cherished for its robust flavors and is often enjoyed as a special dish for breakfast or on festive occasions.</p>
