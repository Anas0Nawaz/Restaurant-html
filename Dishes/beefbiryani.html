    <p>Beef biryani is a hearty and flavorful dish popular in South Asian cuisine, particularly in countries like India and Pakistan. It features tender pieces of beef marinated in a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder. The beef is layered with fragrant basmati rice that has been infused with saffron and other aromatic spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Caramelized onions, yogurt, and sometimes potatoes are also added to enhance the dish's richness and complexity. Garnished with fresh cilantro, mint, and fried onions, beef biryani is typically served with raita (yogurt sauce) or salad, offering a satisfying and aromatic culinary experience.</p>
