    <p>Aloo samosa is a popular Indian snack that consists of a crispy, triangular pastry filled with a savory mixture of spiced potatoes (aloo). The filling is typically made by saut√©ing potatoes with onions, peas, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. This mixture is then enclosed in a thin, crispy dough made from flour and water, which is folded into a triangle shape and deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. Aloo samosas are often served hot and are enjoyed with tamarind chutney or mint chutney as a delicious appetizer or snack.</p>
