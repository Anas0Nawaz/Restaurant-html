    <p>Italian pizza, also known as Neapolitan pizza, is a traditional style of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. It is characterized by its thin, crispy crust that is often cooked quickly at high temperatures in a wood-fired oven. The simplicity of Italian pizza lies in its minimalistic toppings, typically consisting of fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese (usually buffalo mozzarella), fresh basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil. Sometimes, toppings like sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, prosciutto, or anchovies may be added, but the focus remains on the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Italian pizza is known for its authentic flavors and texture, reflecting the centuries-old pizza-making tradition of Naples and embodying the essence of Italian culinary craftsmanship.</p>
