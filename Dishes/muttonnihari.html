    <p>Mutton Nihari is a rich and flavorful slow-cooked stew that originated in the Indian subcontinent, particularly
        popular in Pakistan and Northern India. It features tender pieces of mutton (goat meat) simmered for hours in a
        spicy and aromatic gravy made with a blend of spices such as ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and garam masala.
        The dish is cooked until the meat is incredibly tender and falls off the bone, creating a thick and hearty
        texture. Nihari is traditionally enjoyed for breakfast or as a special meal, served with naan bread or steamed
        rice. Garnished with fresh ginger, chopped cilantro, and slices of lemon, mutton nihari is a beloved dish known
        for its depth of flavor and comforting warmth.</p>
